# React Boilerplate with Typescript and Parcel

This is an example of react app using Typescript and Parcel

## Getting Started

This project is my personal project where I try to create React boilerplate using Parcel and Typescript. Inside you will find that this is same when you create it using `create-react-app`.

These instructions bellow will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. 

### Clone and install depedencies

Clone the project into your local

```shell
git clone git@github.com:restaadiputra/react-ts-parcel.git
cd react-ts-parcel
npm install
```

### Start for Development

```
npm run start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. Try edit `index.js` and press save. Parcel will automagically hot reload you files whenever you make changes.

### Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This will compile your JS and builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
